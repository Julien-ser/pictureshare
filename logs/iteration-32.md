# Project Agent Instructions (Step 3.5 Flash)

## ROLE DETECTION

**CRITICAL**: Before reading further, check your role:
```bash
cat .agent_role
```

**If your role is one of these SPECIALISTS:**
- `devops-engineer` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/devops-engineer.md`
- `qa-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/qa-specialist.md`
- `release-manager` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/release-manager.md`
- `documentation-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/documentation-specialist.md`
- `project-orchestrator` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/project-orchestrator.md`

**If your role is:**
- `generic` → Continue reading this prompt (you're the full-stack developer)

---

**Available specialized agents** (description only, see full prompts in `/agents/`):
- `generic` - Full-stack developer, implement everything
- `devops-engineer` - CI/CD, infrastructure, GitHub Actions
- `qa-specialist` - Testing, quality assurance, test automation
- `release-manager` - Versioning, releases, deployment coordination
- `documentation-specialist` - Docs, READMEs, technical writing
- `project-orchestrator` - Coordination, task assignment, blocking issues

---

## GENERIC DEVELOPER MODE

## CORE MISSION
1. Read `TASKS.md`
2. Complete ONE task per iteration
3. Update `TASKS.md` with progress: Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Commit & push to GitHub
5. Repeat until all tasks done

## CRITICAL: ALWAYS DO FIRST

**Task 0: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup** (Do before Task 1)

Detect tech stack from these files:
| File | Language |
|------|----------|
| `package.json` | Node.js |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | Python |
| `go.mod` or `go.sum` | Go |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Java |
| `Dockerfile` (only) | Docker |
| None | Shell/Unknown |

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` using the correct template:

<details>
<summary>Node.js Template</summary>

```
</details>

**Then commit IMMEDIATELY:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/test.yml TASKS.md
git commit -m "ci: setup github actions workflow"
git push origin main
```

## WORKFLOW (Every Iteration)

1. **Read the current task** from TASKS.md
2. **Understand requirements** - Ask clarifying questions if blocked
3. **Implement** - Write code/docs
4. **Test locally** - Verify it works
5. **Commit** - `git add . && git commit -m "Feature: description" && git push`
6. **Update TASKS.md** - Mark `[x]` when DONE
7. **Next iteration** - Move to next task

## CONSTRAINTS

- ❌ NO virtual environments (`venv`, `virtualenv`, `.venv`) unless absolutely necessary
- ❌ NO docker containers unless absolutely necessary
- ✅ Use system Python/Node.js directly
- ✅ Keep dependencies minimal
- ✅ Write tests alongside code

## CALLING SPECIALIZED AGENTS

If a task needs a specialist you can't handle alone, update `.agent_role`:

```bash
# Switch to a specialist for specific work
echo "devops-engineer" > .agent_role
git add .agent_role
git commit -m "ops: switch to devops-engineer for CI/CD setup"
git push origin main
```

After switching, the next iteration will load that agent's expertise.

**Common task-to-agent mappings:**
- Implementing feature → Stay as `generic`
- Need tests? → Switch to `qa-specialist`
- Ready to release? → Switch to `release-manager`
- Need better docs? → Switch to `documentation-specialist`
- Complex multi-part work? → Switch to `project-orchestrator`
- Setting up CI/CD? → Switch to `devops-engineer`

Switch back to `generic` when the specialist work is done.

---

**Now start: Check `.agent_role` and read TASKS.md**

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 32)

```
# pictureshare

**Mission:** App for event photo sharing
All participants scan a written code and pictures they sent will be accessible to all in da group n vice versa

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup

- [x] Choose tech stack: React Native (Expo), Firebase (Auth/Firestore/Storage), react-native-camera, qrcode library; document in ADR
- [x] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript, configure ESLint/Prettier, and set up folder structure: components/, screens/, services/, utils/
- [x] Create low-fidelity wireframes for: Event Join (QR scanner), Photo Feed, Upload Interface, Profile Screen
- [x] Set up Firebase project with security rules baseline, initialize local emulators for development

## Phase 2: Authentication & Event Code System

- [x] Implement Firebase Anonymous Auth + Google Sign-In as fallback; store user mapping locally
- [x] Build event creation screen: generates 6-digit alphanumeric code, optional time/visibility settings
- [x] Integrate `react-native-qrcode-svg` to display event QR code for sharing; encode deep link with event ID
- [x] Develop QR scanner screen using `expo-camera`; validate code against Firestore and join user to event document's participants array

## Phase 3: Photo Capture, Compression & Upload

- [x] Build camera/gallery picker with `expo-image-picker`; request permissions and handle denials with explanatory UI
- [x] Add image compression pipeline: use `expo-image-manipulator` to resize to ≤1920px, compress to 80% quality
- [x] Implement upload service: upload compressed image to Firebase Storage path `/events/{eventId}/photos/{photoId}.jpg`
- [x] Save photo metadata to Firestore collection `photos` with fields: eventId, uploaderId, storagePath, createdAt, thumbnailPath

## Phase 4: Real-Time Feed & Sync

- [x] Subscribe to Firestore `photos` collection query `where eventId == current` with real-time listener; render in FlatList
- [x] Implement optimistic UI: add photo to feed immediately after upload, mark pending, finalize on server confirmation
- [x] Build infinite scroll pagination using Firestore cursor; load 20 initial photos, fetch more on scroll
- [x] Add offline-first behavior: cache photos locally with `expo-file-system`; retry failed uploads when back online

## Phase 5: Group Permissions & Interactions

- [x] Enable deletion: only photo owner or event creator can delete; remove from Storage and Firestore
- [x] Add likes: create `likes` subcollection under each photo; toggle like on press; update aggregated like count
- [ ] Create lightweight comments: allow short text on photos; store in `comments` subcollection; real-time updates
- [ ] Show participant list per event with avatars (from Google Auth) and photo count; differentiate current user

## Phase 6: Testing, Polish & Launch

- [ ] Write unit tests for utilities (code generation, image compression) and service wrappers using Jest
- [ ] Create integration tests with Firebase Emulators: test event join flow, upload, and real-time feed
- [ ] Perform closed beta: distribute via Expo Go, collect feedback on UX and performance
- [ ] Deploy to app stores: configure EAS build, submit to Apple TestFlight and Google Play Internal; monitor Firebase Crashlytics

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
Create lightweight comments: allow short text on photos; store in `comments` subcollection; real-time updates

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. Also update README.md to match this project (name, setup instructions, current progress). No permission needed—just act.

I'll continue implementing the comments feature. Let me first check the current state of the codebase to understand the existing patterns.

Good! I can see:
- The `Comment` type is already defined in types
- Photo type already has `commentCount`
- PhotoFeedScreen already has placeholder for comments modal and is importing `commentService`
- I need to create the actual `commentService.ts`, `CommentItem` component, and `CommentsModal` component

Let me start by creating the comment service following the likeService pattern:

Good! The commentService.ts already exists. Now I need to create:
1. CommentItem component
2. CommentsModal component  
3. Update PhotoFeedScreen to properly open the modal and implement comment deletion

Let me create the CommentItem component first:

Perfect! All the components already exist. Now I need to update PhotoFeedScreen to properly integrate the CommentsModal. The comment button currently shows an alert. I need to:

1. Update the comment button to open the modal with the photoId
2. Display the actual comment count instead of "Comment"
3. Add the CommentsModal component to the render

Let me update the PhotoFeedScreen:

Please read the file again before modifying it.
I can see the file has already been partially updated. The comment button now calls `handleOpenComments(item.id)` and shows the comment count. I need to add the missing handler function and render the modal. Let me add them:
[0m→ [0mRead src/screens/PhotoFeedScreen.tsx
Good! The PhotoFeedScreen is already fully updated. Now let me check if there's an issue with commentService.ts - it uses `getDocs` but I need to verify it's imported:
[0m→ [0mRead src/services/commentService.ts
I notice there's an unused import `QuerySnapshot` and the function is missing `getCommentsForPhoto`. But since the CommentsModal uses `subscribeToComments` directly, it's fine. The implementation appears complete. Let me now check TASKS.md and README.md to update them.
[0m→ [0mRead README.md
