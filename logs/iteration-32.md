### Current Task: Write unit tests for utilities (code generation, image compression) and service wrappers using Jest

### Build/Test Error - Fix Code Only

**Context:** The build or test command failed. Your job is to fix it.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Do NOT install system tools, download large files, or set up external environments
- Only modify code, config files, and dependency versions
- If error requires external setup → document in README, skip from CI

**Error from last attempt:**

```

**Decision:**
- **Is this a code/syntax error?** → Fix the code
- **Is this a missing/version dependency error?** → Update the version constraint
- **Is this an environment/setup error?** → Mark in README as prerequisite, exclude from CI, or skip

**Do the minimal fix to make the error go away, then commit.**

Looking at the error, there's a test failure in `participantService.ts:80` where `console.error` is called, and the test expects data but receives an empty array. Let me examine the code.

# pictureshare

**Mission:** App for event photo sharing
All participants scan a written code and pictures they sent will be accessible to all in da group n vice versa

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup

- [x] Choose tech stack: React Native (Expo), Firebase (Auth/Firestore/Storage), react-native-camera, qrcode library; document in ADR
- [x] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript, configure ESLint/Prettier, and set up folder structure: components/, screens/, services/, utils/
- [x] Create low-fidelity wireframes for: Event Join (QR scanner), Photo Feed, Upload Interface, Profile Screen
- [x] Set up Firebase project with security rules baseline, initialize local emulators for development

## Phase 2: Authentication & Event Code System

- [x] Implement Firebase Anonymous Auth + Google Sign-In as fallback; store user mapping locally
- [x] Build event creation screen: generates 6-digit alphanumeric code, optional time/visibility settings
- [x] Integrate `react-native-qrcode-svg` to display event QR code for sharing; encode deep link with event ID
- [x] Develop QR scanner screen using `expo-camera`; validate code against Firestore and join user to event document's participants array

## Phase 3: Photo Capture, Compression & Upload

- [x] Build camera/gallery picker with `expo-image-picker`; request permissions and handle denials with explanatory UI
- [x] Add image compression pipeline: use `expo-image-manipulator` to resize to ≤1920px, compress to 80% quality
- [x] Implement upload service: upload compressed image to Firebase Storage path `/events/{eventId}/photos/{photoId}.jpg`
- [x] Save photo metadata to Firestore collection `photos` with fields: eventId, uploaderId, storagePath, createdAt, thumbnailPath

## Phase 4: Real-Time Feed & Sync

- [x] Subscribe to Firestore `photos` collection query `where eventId == current` with real-time listener; render in FlatList
- [x] Implement optimistic UI: add photo to feed immediately after upload, mark pending, finalize on server confirmation
- [x] Build infinite scroll pagination using Firestore cursor; load 20 initial photos, fetch more on scroll
- [x] Add offline-first behavior: cache photos locally with `expo-file-system`; retry failed uploads when back online

## Phase 5: Group Permissions & Interactions

- [x] Enable deletion: only photo owner or event creator can delete; remove from Storage and Firestore
- [x] Add likes: create `likes` subcollection under each photo; toggle like on press; update aggregated like count
- [x] Create lightweight comments: allow short text on photos; store in `comments` subcollection; real-time updates
- [x] Show participant list per event with avatars (from Google Auth) and photo count; differentiate current user

## Phase 6: Testing, Polish & Launch

- [ ] Write unit tests for utilities (code generation, image compression) and service wrappers using Jest
- [ ] Create integration tests with Firebase Emulators: test event join flow, upload, and real-time feed
- [ ] Perform closed beta: distribute via Expo Go, collect feedback on UX and performance
- [ ] Deploy to app stores: configure EAS build, submit to Apple TestFlight and Google Play Internal; monitor Firebase Crashlytics
