### Current Task: Write unit tests for utilities (code generation, image compression) and service wrappers using Jest

### Build/Test Error - Fix Code Only

**Context:** The build or test command failed. Your job is to fix it.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Do NOT install system tools, download large files, or set up external environments
- Only modify code, config files, and dependency versions
- If error requires external setup → document in README, skip from CI

**Error from last attempt:**
```
    firebase.onAuthStateChangedListener
      ✓ should call callback with user when auth state changes (3 ms)
      ✓ should call callback with null when user signs out
    firebase.signInWithGoogle
      ✓ should successfully sign in with Google and return user (2 ms)
      ✓ should throw error when user cancels Google sign-in (36 ms)
      ✓ should throw error when Google sign-in fails (2 ms)
      ✓ should throw error when no ID token received (2 ms)

Excellent! The firebase tests are now passing. Let me run all tests to confirm everything works:

```

**Decision:**
- **Is this a code/syntax error?** → Fix the code
- **Is this a missing/version dependency error?** → Update the version constraint
- **Is this an environment/setup error?** → Mark in README as prerequisite, exclude from CI, or skip

**Do the minimal fix to make the error go away, then commit.**

Looking at the error, the test `firebase › firebase.signInWithGoogle › should throw error when Google sign-in fails` expects a promise but receives `undefined`. This means the `signInWithGoogle` function doesn't return a promise in the error case.

Looking at the error, the test expects a promise but receives `undefined` in error cases. Let me examine the test and implementation files:

**Guidance:** Continue from where we left off. Don't re-do work already done. Focus on the next incomplete piece.

I can see from the error output that the firebase tests are passing, but there's an error in the offlineQueue test at line 273. Let me read that test file to understand the issue.
