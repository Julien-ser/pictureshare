### Current Task: Write unit tests for utilities (code generation, image compression) and service wrappers using Jest

### Build/Test Error - Fix Code Only

**Context:** The build or test command failed. Your job is to fix it.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Do NOT install system tools, download large files, or set up external environments
- Only modify code, config files, and dependency versions
- If error requires external setup → document in README, skip from CI

**Error from last attempt:**

**Decision:**
- **Is this a code/syntax error?** → Fix the code
- **Is this a missing/version dependency error?** → Update the version constraint
- **Is this an environment/setup error?** → Mark in README as prerequisite, exclude from CI, or skip

**Do the minimal fix to make the error go away, then commit.**

Looking at the error, there's a test failure in `__tests__/offlineQueue.test.ts:273` where an "Error: Init error" is being thrown. Let me examine the test and the offline queue implementation to understand the issue.

Now let me examine the offlineQueue implementation to see how it handles initialization errors:

# pictureshare

**Mission:** App for event photo sharing
All participants scan a written code and pictures they sent will be accessible to all in da group n vice versa

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup

- [x] Choose tech stack: React Native (Expo), Firebase (Auth/Firestore/Storage), react-native-camera, qrcode library; document in ADR
- [x] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript, configure ESLint/Prettier, and set up folder structure: components/, screens/, services/, utils/
- [x] Create low-fidelity wireframes for: Event Join (QR scanner), Photo Feed, Upload Interface, Profile Screen
- [x] Set up Firebase project with security rules baseline, initialize local emulators for development

## Phase 2: Authentication & Event Code System

- [x] Implement Firebase Anonymous Auth + Google Sign-In as fallback; store user mapping locally
- [x] Build event creation screen: generates 6-digit alphanumeric code, optional time/visibility settings
- [x] Integrate `react-native-qrcode-svg` to display event QR code for sharing; encode deep link with event ID
- [x] Develop QR scanner screen using `expo-camera`; validate code against Firestore and join user to event document's participants array

## Phase 3: Photo Capture, Compression & Upload

- [x] Build camera/gallery picker with `expo-image-picker`; request permissions and handle denials with explanatory UI
- [x] Add image compression pipeline: use `expo-image-manipulator` to resize to ≤1920px, compress to 80% quality
- [x] Implement upload service: upload compressed image to Firebase Storage path `/events/{eventId}/photos/{photoId}.jpg`
- [x] Save photo metadata to Firestore collection `photos` with fields: eventId, uploaderId, storagePath, createdAt, thumbnailPath

## Phase 4: Real-Time Feed & Sync

- [x] Subscribe to Firestore `photos` collection query `where eventId == current` with real-time listener; render in FlatList
- [x] Implement optimistic UI: add photo to feed immediately after upload, mark pending, finalize on server confirmation
- [x] Build infinite scroll pagination using Firestore cursor; load 20 initial photos, fetch more on scroll
- [x] Add offline-first behavior: cache photos locally with `expo-file-system`; retry failed uploads when back online

## Phase 5: Group Permissions & Interactions

- [x] Enable deletion: only photo owner or event creator can delete; remove from Storage and Firestore
- [x] Add likes: create `likes` subcollection under each photo; toggle like on press; update aggregated like count
- [x] Create lightweight comments: allow short text on photos; store in `comments` subcollection; real-time updates
- [x] Show participant list per event with avatars (from Google Auth) and photo count; differentiate current user

## Phase 6: Testing, Polish & Launch

- [ ] Write unit tests for utilities (code generation, image compression) and service wrappers using Jest
- [ ] Create integration tests with Firebase Emulators: test event join flow, upload, and real-time feed
- [ ] Perform closed beta: distribute via Expo Go, collect feedback on UX and performance
- [ ] Deploy to app stores: configure EAS build, submit to Apple TestFlight and Google Play Internal; monitor Firebase Crashlytics
