# Project Agent Instructions (Step 3.5 Flash)

## ROLE DETECTION

**CRITICAL**: Before reading further, check your role:
```bash
cat .agent_role
```

**If your role is one of these SPECIALISTS:**
- `devops-engineer` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/devops-engineer.md`
- `qa-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/qa-specialist.md`
- `release-manager` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/release-manager.md`
- `documentation-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/documentation-specialist.md`
- `project-orchestrator` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/project-orchestrator.md`

**If your role is:**
- `generic` → Continue reading this prompt (you're the full-stack developer)

---

**Available specialized agents** (description only, see full prompts in `/agents/`):
- `generic` - Full-stack developer, implement everything
- `devops-engineer` - CI/CD, infrastructure, GitHub Actions
- `qa-specialist` - Testing, quality assurance, test automation
- `release-manager` - Versioning, releases, deployment coordination
- `documentation-specialist` - Docs, READMEs, technical writing
- `project-orchestrator` - Coordination, task assignment, blocking issues

---

## GENERIC DEVELOPER MODE

## CORE MISSION
1. Read `TASKS.md`
2. Complete ONE task per iteration
3. Update `TASKS.md` with progress: Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Commit & push to GitHub
5. Repeat until all tasks done

## CRITICAL: ALWAYS DO FIRST

**Task 0: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup** (Do before Task 1)

Detect tech stack from these files:
| File | Language |
|------|----------|
| `package.json` | Node.js |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | Python |
| `go.mod` or `go.sum` | Go |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Java |
| `Dockerfile` (only) | Docker |
| None | Shell/Unknown |

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` using the correct template:

<details>

```

## WORKFLOW (Every Iteration)

1. **Read the current task** from TASKS.md
2. **Understand requirements** - Ask clarifying questions if blocked
3. **Implement** - Write code/docs
4. **Test locally** - Verify it works
5. **Commit** - `git add . && git commit -m "Feature: description" && git push`
6. **Update TASKS.md** - Mark `[x]` when DONE

---

## CALLING SPECIALIZED AGENTS

If a task needs a specialist you can't handle alone, update `.agent_role`:

```bash
# Switch to a specialist for specific work
echo "devops-engineer" > .agent_role
git add .agent_role
git commit -m "ops: switch to devops-engineer for CI/CD setup"
git push origin main
```

After switching, the next iteration will load that agent's expertise.

**Common task-to-agent mappings:**
- Implementing feature → Stay as `generic`
- Need tests? → Switch to `qa-specialist`
- Ready to release? → Switch to `release-manager`
- Need better docs? → Switch to `documentation-specialist`
- Complex multi-part work? → Switch to `project-orchestrator`
- Setting up CI/CD? → Switch to `devops-engineer`

Switch back to `generic` when the specialist work is done.

---

**Now start: Check `.agent_role` and read TASKS.md**

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 22 / 64k Token Budget
- Attempt: 2 (previous attempts may have partial progress)
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.

Let me check the current implementation of the optimistic UI to see what's already in place:
```
```

**Guidance:** Continue from where we left off. Don't re-do work already done. Focus on the next incomplete piece.


## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 22)

```
# pictureshare

**Mission:** App for event photo sharing
All participants scan a written code and pictures they sent will be accessible to all in da group n vice versa

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup

- [x] Choose tech stack: React Native (Expo), Firebase (Auth/Firestore/Storage), react-native-camera, qrcode library; document in ADR
- [x] Initialize Expo project with TypeScript, configure ESLint/Prettier, and set up folder structure: components/, screens/, services/, utils/
- [x] Create low-fidelity wireframes for: Event Join (QR scanner), Photo Feed, Upload Interface, Profile Screen
- [x] Set up Firebase project with security rules baseline, initialize local emulators for development

## Phase 2: Authentication & Event Code System

- [x] Implement Firebase Anonymous Auth + Google Sign-In as fallback; store user mapping locally
- [x] Build event creation screen: generates 6-digit alphanumeric code, optional time/visibility settings
- [x] Integrate `react-native-qrcode-svg` to display event QR code for sharing; encode deep link with event ID
- [x] Develop QR scanner screen using `expo-camera`; validate code against Firestore and join user to event document's participants array

## Phase 3: Photo Capture, Compression & Upload

- [x] Build camera/gallery picker with `expo-image-picker`; request permissions and handle denials with explanatory UI
- [x] Add image compression pipeline: use `expo-image-manipulator` to resize to ≤1920px, compress to 80% quality
- [x] Implement upload service: upload compressed image to Firebase Storage path `/events/{eventId}/photos/{photoId}.jpg`
- [x] Save photo metadata to Firestore collection `photos` with fields: eventId, uploaderId, storagePath, createdAt, thumbnailPath

## Phase 4: Real-Time Feed & Sync

- [x] Subscribe to Firestore `photos` collection query `where eventId == current` with real-time listener; render in FlatList
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI: add photo to feed immediately after upload, mark pending, finalize on server confirmation
- [ ] Build infinite scroll pagination using Firestore cursor; load 20 initial photos, fetch more on scroll
- [ ] Add offline-first behavior: cache photos locally with `expo-file-system`; retry failed uploads when back online

## Phase 5: Group Permissions & Interactions

- [ ] Enable deletion: only photo owner or event creator can delete; remove from Storage and Firestore
- [ ] Add likes: create `likes` subcollection under each photo; toggle like on press; update aggregated like count
- [ ] Create lightweight comments: allow short text on photos; store in `comments` subcollection; real-time updates
- [ ] Show participant list per event with avatars (from Google Auth) and photo count; differentiate current user

## Phase 6: Testing, Polish & Launch

- [ ] Write unit tests for utilities (code generation, image compression) and service wrappers using Jest
- [ ] Create integration tests with Firebase Emulators: test event join flow, upload, and real-time feed
- [ ] Perform closed beta: distribute via Expo Go, collect feedback on UX and performance
- [ ] Deploy to app stores: configure EAS build, submit to Apple TestFlight and Google Play Internal; monitor Firebase Crashlytics

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
Implement optimistic UI: add photo to feed immediately after upload, mark pending, finalize on server confirmation

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. Also update README.md to match this project (name, setup instructions, current progress). No permission needed—just act.

Now I understand the codebase. The PhotoContext already has infrastructure for optimistic UI with `pendingPhotos` and `addPendingPhoto`/`removePendingPhoto` functions. I need to:

1. Update Photo type to include `localUri` for pending photos
2. Modify UploadInterface to add pending photos before upload
3. Update PhotoFeedScreen to use PhotoContext and display pending photos with a visual indicator
